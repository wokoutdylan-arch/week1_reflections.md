# Week 1 Reflection

This week we reviewed important object oriented programming concepts in Python, especially the __init__ method. I was reminded that __init__ runs automatically when a new object is created and is used to initialize the object’s attributes. This helped reinforce how each object can hold its own data even though they come from the same class. We also went over the purpose of self, which refers to the specific instance of the class. Using self allows each object to access and modify its own data. Without it, Python would not know which object’s variables or methods we are referring to. Another concept we refreshed was how one function can depend on another. Inside a class, methods can call other methods using self, which helps break a big task into smaller steps. This makes code more organized, reusable, and easier to understand. We also talked about HAS-A relationships, which describe when one class contains an object of another class. Instead of inheriting features, a class is built using other objects as parts of it. For example, a Car class might have an Engine object. This shows that a car has an engine. This concept helped me understand how larger programs are structured using smaller, connected components.
